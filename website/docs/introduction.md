A curated collection of over 60 custom commands for the [YAGPDB Discord Bot](https://yagpdb.xyz) to enhance your server.

It is:

- **Extensive:** There are over 60 custom commands (and we're adding more regularly!), meaning that it's likely that you'll be able to find what you're looking for.
- **Official:** This collection of commands is [maintained by a group of YAGPDB staff members](#contributors) and has official support.
- **Well tested:** We review all commands added and many commands have widespread usage, meaning that it's unlikely - [though not impossible](#disclaimer) - for there to be serious bugs in them.
- **Well documented:** We take pride in our high quality of documentation. It should be _easy_ for someone to figure out how to use any command here given that they are willing to read and have common sense.

Now that you know a little about the project, we suggest that you take a look around to see if there's something that you like. If you're not sure of how to add custom commands from here, please refer to [this page](adding-ccs).

## Disclaimer

The YAGPDB developer, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any issues with or caused by these custom commands. Furthermore, though we thoroughly review all commands added, they are not guaranteed to be working; use them at your own risk.
